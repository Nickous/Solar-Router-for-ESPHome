# About

Early 2024, I built a solar router following the instruction of [F1ATB](https://f1atb.fr) ![france](images/france.png). This solar router is very versatil but I was not satisfy about the integration with [HomeAssistant](https://homeassistant.io).  
I then found the job made by [Rem81](https://domo.rem81.com/) ![france](images/france.png) who create a solar router directly [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) and I thought it was certainly possible to have the modularity of F1ATB router with the level of integration in Home Assistant of an ESPHome device... and this project was born.
